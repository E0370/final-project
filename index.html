                    <h2>Students have difficulty finding reliable study resources online</h2>
                </header>
                <p>Students often struggle to find reliable study materials online. There are many websites and
                    resources,
                    but not all of them are accurate or useful. It's easy to get lost in a sea of low-quality notes,
                    unclear
                    videos, and outdated practice questions. This wastes a lot of time and causes frustration,
                    especially
                    when preparing for exams. What students really need is a single, easy-to-use platform with all the
                    high-quality resources they need in one place. This would help them find trustworthy notes, helpful
                    videos, and effective quizzes quickly. With better access to reliable materials, students can spend
                    less time searching and more time focusing on learning and improving their grades.</p>

                    these

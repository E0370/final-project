            <h2>Students have difficulty finding reliable study resources  online</h2>
            <p>Students often struggle to find reliable study materials online. There are many websites and resources,
        but not all of them are accurate or useful. It's easy to get lost in a sea of low-quality notes, unclear videos, and outdated 
        practice questions. This wastes a lot of time and causes frustration,especially when preparing for exams. What students really
        need is a single, easy-to-use platform with all the high-quality resources they need in one place. This would help them find 
        trustworthy notes, helpful videos, and effective quizzes quickly. With better access to reliable materials, students can spend 
        less time searching and more time focusing on learning and improving their grades.
